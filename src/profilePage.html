<!-- Create a profile page for yourself! It should have the following elements:
One heading with your name as the content
1-2 paragraph tags talking about yourself

Another heading with "Lists" as the content
Two lists:
One ordered list of your top 5 foods
One unordered list of the JS concepts/features/exercises that you enjoyed

Another heading with "Images" as the content
Two images of anything

Use divs to create 3 sections/groups for the content you created above (each div should contain a heading and the related content) -->

    <p>About ten years ago, I decided to spend my free time writing novels. Willingly, believe it or not.</p>
    <p>And the thing is, if you write a book and want to read it in proper form, you have to make an e-publication of it some way down the line.</p>
    <p>Here's the kicker: an .epub file is just a bunch of .xhtml files and .css, which gives me a whooping advantage here.</p>
